# React Native Bootcamp ‚Äî A Curriculum for Beginners

> A series of **React Native coding challenges** with a variety of difficulties for busy developers.

This course is adapted from a freelance engineer, [David Leuliette](https://github.com/flexbox), who has used `react-native` since 2017 and has 15+ years of experience shipping products with `JavaScript`. This bootcamp encapsulates all the problems a `react-native` developer encounters in their daily job and all the things developers wish they knew **before** starting their career as a React Native Developer.

My project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

üì± Hearty thanks to the [team behind expo](https://expo.dev/), the open-source platform for making universal native apps with React that run on Android, iOS, and the web.

üé® Thanks as well to all the `react-native-paper` contributors for their easy to use UI library.

üôè Special thanks to [Alex Lobera](https://github.com/alexlbr), [Horacio Herrera](https://twitter.com/hhg2288), [William Candillon](https://github.com/wcandillon), [Satyajit Sahoo](https://github.com/satya164), [Tanner Linsley](https://github.com/tannerlinsley), [Brent Vatne](https://github.com/brentvatne).

## Getting Started

This fork is intended for use in [Mr. Chisolm's](https://github.com/mchisolm0) classroom. If you come across this bootcamp and are not my student, you may want the original by David [here](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp)

Challenge after challenge, you are going to build this mobile appliction to buy Star Wars space ships using `TypeScript`, `expo`, `react-native` and `react-query`.

## Pedagogy

There are two pedagogical tenets in this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based**, with **up-to-date dependencies** and that it **includes frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common theme ‚Äîcreate a mobile app with real API‚Äî to give it cohesion.
