# Stack Navigator

## üì° What you will learn

- Organise your routes and name your screens.
- How to use the `react-navigation` library with the `navigation` prop.

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- There are others routing solutions available, keep in mind **we are using [`react-navigation` library](https://reactnavigation.org/)**.
- We are using the last version of `react-navigation` (_Be carreful when you randomly copy/paste Stack Overflow_).
- TypeScript definitions are a bit complicated with `react-navigation`, for now just ignore them.

Here is a preview of our application user flow:

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 1

### Installation

- [ ] Read the [Getting started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/#installation) guide to:
  1. Install the required packages in your React Native project.
  1. Install dependencies into an Expo managed project.

**üî≠ Hint:** you just installed **the core packages**, for every type of navigator (`Native Stack`, `Drawer`, `Bottom Tabs`‚Ä¶) you will need to **install other packages**.

### Create a Navigator file

- [ ] Create a new component called `Navigator.tsx` on `./src/navigation/`
- [ ] return a [`NavigationContainer` from `@react-navigation/native`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started#wrapping-your-app-in-navigationcontainer).
- [ ] Update the **entry point of your application**, `App.tsx` to  import your component `<Navigator />`.

### Create your first Stack

- [ ] Read the [`Stack.Navigator` documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation).
- [ ] Create a Stack Navigator in `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx` that shows the `LoginScreen` and the `TermsScreen`.

You will have something like this:

```javascript
<Stack.Screen name="Terms" component={TermsScreen} />
```

**üî≠ Hint:** You can have multiple `function`s in the same file.

### Navigate to another screen

Do you remeber the `<Text>` "by login you accept the Terms and Conditions."? We will use the `navigate()` function to go to another screen.

![react-navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-navigation/react-navigation-focus.png)

- [ ] Wrap the terms link with a

```javascript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={navigateToTerms}>
  ...
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Here is a function to navigate between screens:

```javascript
function navigateToTerms() {
  navigation.navigate('Terms');
}
```

- [ ] Add a `goBack` behavior on `TermsScreen.tsx`

### Options for screens

- [ ] On the `TermsScreen`, we have an issue with the double header, we can fix it with some options within the `Navigator`

```javascript
<Stack.Navigator screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
  ...
</Stack.Navigator>
```

## üëΩ Bonus

### Create a files with all your screens

We are going to create a "sitemap" of all our routes. This will help-us in the long run to have a single source of truth.

> We will use a [TypeScript feature called `const` assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions).

```javascript
// ./src/navigation/Routes.ts

const Routes {
  LOGIN_SCREEN: "Login",
  TERMS_SCREEN: "Terms", // We will use Routes.TERMS_SCREEN to navigate later
  STARSHIP_FEED_SCREEN: "Starships",
  STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN: "Starship",
} as const;
```

- [ ] Create a `Routes.ts` file in `./src/navigation/`
- [ ] Update the `name` of the screens with the `Routes` constants.

```javascript
<Stack.Screen name={Routes.TERMS_SCREEN} component={TermsScreen} />
```

- [ ] Udpate when using `navigate` props, use the `Routes` constants.

```javascript
function navigateToTerms() {
  navigation.navigate(Routes.TERMS_SCREEN);
}
```
