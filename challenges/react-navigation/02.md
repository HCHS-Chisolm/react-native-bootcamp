# Passing datas though Screens

![Passing data with react-navigation](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o84svPyVceu6Oiudi/giphy.gif)

## 📡 What you will learn

- Read `params` from the `route` props

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- Check the [navigation-prop documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/#navigate)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

### Navigating to another screens with `params`

Go to `src/screens/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx`:

- [ ] The header title for this view should be `Starships`
- [ ] Implement `handlePress` function to send the user to the `STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN`, passing the `starship` data as parameters

**Hint:** If you are lost you can [debug the changes on the `NavigationContainer` with `onStateChange`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container/#initialstate)

### Create a details Screen

Go and create `src/Screens/StarshipDetailScreen.tsx`:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-navigation/details-screen.png" alt="react-navigation details screen" width="50%" height="50%" />

- [ ] Read the params in your screen component with `route.params`

You can use these component to make it pretty:

```javascript
import {
  Text,
  Chip,
  DataTable,
  List,
} from "react-native-paper";
```

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Change the `screenOptions` to display your screen as a `modal`
- [ ] Add a "close modal" Button with an icon
