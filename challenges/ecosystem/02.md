> When you adhere to standards, developers know what to expect, learnability is increased, and confusion is reduced.

## 📡 What you will learn

- Having **concistency across every files** in your codebase
- Install linter extensions on VS Code
- Run a linter using a cli tool from the terminal

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- [ ] Subscribe to [William Candillon channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC806fwFWpiLQV5y-qifzHnA) because the videos are insane
- [ ] Open [repo.new](https://repo.new) and create a new repo
- [ ] ❗ Commit your work if it's not already done.
- [ ] Push your code to GitHub.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

Here is a list of the extensions we are going to install:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

There is 2 ways to install extentions.

The manual way:

1. Launch VS Code Quick Open
  - macOS (`cmd` + `shift` + `p`)
  - windows (`ctrl` + `shift` + `p`)
2. Type ">install extensions"
3. Search the name
4. Click on "install"

The automtated way:

- [ ] open your terminal and run

```console
ext install dbaeumer.vscode-eslint esbenp.prettier-vscode
```

### Automatically format your code on each save

- [ ] Go to **Code** (or **File**) > **Preferences** > **Settings**

1. Write `format` on the search input
2. ✅ Editor: Format on save
3. _Optional_ sometimes you have conflicts with others formatters. If it's not working just force the usage with `Prettier - code formatter`

### Setup ESLint rules on your project

We can spend hours configuring ESLint rules... or we can simply use rules used by the community and install the ones from William.

- [ ] Install [`eslint-config-react-native-wcandillon`](https://github.com/wcandillon/eslint-config-react-native-wcandillon#readme)

**Hint:** If you want to create a file from the terminal you can use `echo`:

```console
# ⚠️ For linux and macOS users only

echo '{ "extends": "react-native-wcandillon" }' > .eslintrc
```

When you work as a team, we want to have **the same setup for everyone**. Consistency and adhere to standards across all your files is vital to your application success over time.

- [ ] Install `eslint` to your project (_If it's not already the case_)

```console
yarn add eslint --dev
```

- [ ] Update your scripts on `package.json` to check errors

```json
// package.json

  "scripts": {
    ...
    "lint": "eslint --ignore-path .gitignore --ext .js,.ts,.tsx ."
    ...
  }
```

Now you can run the `lint` script to teel if you have errors

```console
yarn lint
```

You don't need to manullay lint your files. We can run a script for that with:

```console
yarn lint --fix
# same as `npm run lint -- --fix`
```

- [ ] Run `yarn lint --fix` to automatically fix your errors
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Push your project to GitHub to have a backup with `git push`
