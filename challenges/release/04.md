# React Native Release

## üì° What you will learn

- Deploy a Progressive Web App using `react-native-web` to a website

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- You need to have a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/)

### What is a PWA?

A PWA (Progressive Web App) is a web application that is designed to work offline and can be installed on the user's device, just like a native mobile app.

It combines the best of both worlds, providing a native app-like experience within the web browser. It's usefull to have this solution for 2 reasons:

1. Sharing logic between your web and of native mobile app.
2. Have a fallback solution if your users are using old smartphones or a [brand without Google Play support](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49754376).

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 4

We are going to build a PWA with `react-native-web`.

- [ ] Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).
- [ ] Build your Expo web app

```console
expo build:web
```

- [ ] Deploy to vercel with:

```console
cd web-build
vercel
```

You should see a URL that you can use to view your project online. Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app!

‚ö†Ô∏è It's important to note that while `react-native-web` allows you to build a PWA that has a native app-like user experience, it's still a web app and will not have all of the capabilities of a native app. For example, it will not have access to native device features, such as the camera or Bluetooth, unless they are available through a web API.

## üëΩ Bonus

We can automate the release process with GitHub actions. This script will trigger the action to run whenever a change is pushed to the `main` branch or a pull request is merged into `main`.

- [ ] Create a file on your GitHub repository `.github/workflows/production.yml`
- [ ] Add a "üì¶ Build Expo Web" and "üì¶ Vercel Deploy" step

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

steps:
  - name: Expo Web
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    uses: expo/expo-github-action@v5
    with:
      expo-username: ${{ secrets.EXPO_CLI_USERNAME }}
      expo-password: ${{ secrets.EXPO_CLI_PASSWORD }}
      expo-cache: true

  - name: Install dependencies
    if: steps.yarn-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true' && (github.event_name == 'push' || github.event_name == 'pull_request')
    run: yarn

  - name: üì¶ Build Expo Web
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    working-directory: ./packages/app
    run: expo build:web

  - name: üì¶ Vercel Deploy
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20.0.0
    with:
      vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
      vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
      scope: TEAM

```

- [ ] Change `${{ secrets.XXX }}` on your repository Secrets Settings [https://github.com/:username/:repository/settings/secrets/actions](https://github.com/:username/:repository/settings/secrets/actions)
