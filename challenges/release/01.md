To use EAS, you will need to install the `eas-cli` package globally. Go to your terminal and run the following command.

```console
npm i -g eas-cli
eas login
```

#### Init

```console
eas init
✔ Linked to project @weshipit/spacecraft
✔ Linked app.json to project with ID 012aaaa3-4ce5-4bae-9f4d-2f842489f07a
```

### Build

Create [your first build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/)

```console
eas build:configure
```

After finishing this configuration. You will get a new `eas.json` file in the root directory of your current project.

```console
eas build
✔ Select platform › Android
✔ Linked to project @weshipit/spacecraft
✔ Using remote Android credentials (Expo server)
```

On your [Expo account](https://expo.dev), you should have someting like this:

### Submitting your app to the store

```console
eas submit
✔ Select platform › Android
✔ Linked to project @weshipit/spacecraft
```

EAS will use your latest build for the submission by default, but you can manually specify a previous build if you want.

If you are stuck, run `eas submit --help` from the terminal to get informations.
