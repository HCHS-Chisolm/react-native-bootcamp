## What you will learn

- Generate a development build and try our app without Expo Go.

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- Have a look at ["create development builds" documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/development/create-development-builds/#on-a-device)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3

- [ ] Update your `eas.json` file to [create and install an EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/development/create-development-builds/#create-and-install-eas-build)

### Android
