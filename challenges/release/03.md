# Strategies for beta testing on real device

## What you will learn

- Generate a development build and try our app without Expo Go.

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- Have a look at ["create development builds" documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/development/create-development-builds/#on-a-device)

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 3

- [ ] Update your `eas.json` file to [create and install an EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/development/create-development-builds/#create-and-install-eas-build)

### Android

- [ ] build a `development` binary on the expo platform for `android`

To create and install the development build on an Android device, you will need a `.apk`. To create it, run the following command:

```console
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

- [ ] After the build is complete, copy the `.apk` URL from the build details page or the link provided when `eas build` has finished.

- [ ] Send that URL to your device and open it to download and install the `.apk`.

- [ ] Download the build artifact directly on your device from [expo.dev](https://expo.dev) website

### iOS

- [ ] build a `development` binary on the expo platform for `iOS`

```console
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

You can check this video for beta testing your React Native application with Expo on real `iOS` device.
