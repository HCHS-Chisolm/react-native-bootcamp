# Render a list of data

## üì° What you will learn

- Add a performant Scroll for long lists with `<FlatList>`

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- [ ] Open [repo.new](https://repo.new) and create a new repo

**Repository name:** spacecraft

**Description:** A React Native application build with `expo`. Created during my bootcamp https://davidl.fr/bootcamp

- [ ] ‚ùó Commit your work if it's not already done.
- [ ] Push your code to GitHub.

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 4

### Download dummy data on you computer

- [ ] Run a `curl` from your terminal to download dummy data on your computer.

```console
mkdir api
curl https://swapi.py4e.com/api/starships/ > api/data.json
```

---

‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows users [you can copy/paste this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/api/data.json).

---

We will use `JSON.stringify()` here to render a `string` version of the data

- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx` and paste the content [from this StarshipFeedScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screens/exercice/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Uncomment the lines and to display the array `results` from `data`

Here is a preview of what you should have:

### Render a list of data with `FlatList`

Implement a `FlatList` for the data that is fetched.

- [ ] Read the [`FlatList` documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).
- [ ] Add your array to the props `data`
- [ ] Render `Item` with `name`, `model`, `crew`, `hyperdrive_rating` and `cost_in_credits`
- [ ] If you want to add an `Image` just use this api to generate random images `https://api.lorem.space/image/car`

### üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Use a [Card to render items](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/card.html)
- [ ] On each `Card` display a local Image
  - You will need to use `require("../../assets/starships/imagename.jpg")` for [the Image `source`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image)
  - You can [download all the images here](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/raw/main/hackathon/spacecraft/assets/starships-pictures.zip)
