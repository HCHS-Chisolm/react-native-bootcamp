# React Native Foundation

## üì° What you will learn

- Add a performant Scroll for long lists with `<FlatList>`

Let's now create a different screen!

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 4

### Render a list of data

üõ∞ This is an important feature to display a list of data.

- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx` and paste the content [from this StarshipFeedScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screens/exercice/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Run from your terminal to download dummy data on your computer.

```console
mkdir api
curl https://swapi.py4e.com/api/starships/ > api/data.json
```

---

‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows users [you can copy/paste this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/api/data.json).

---

You should have a "stringifyied" version of the data

- [ ] You should read the art of [`FlaList` documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist)
- [ ] Implement a `FlatList` for the data that is fetched.
  - [ ] Add some dummy data with `data={data.results}`
  - [ ] Render `Item` with `name`, `model`, `crew`, `hyperdrive_rating` and `cost_in_credits`

### üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Use a [Card to render items](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/card.html)
- [ ] On each `Card` display a local Image
  - You will need to use `require("../../assets/starships/imagename.jpg")` for [the Image `source`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image)
  - You can [download all the images here](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/raw/main/hackathon/spacecraft/assets/starships-pictures.zip)
