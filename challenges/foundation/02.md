# Project setup

## 📡 What you will learn

- Use the Expo CLI
- Install the `react-native-paper` library with `yarn`
- Use VSCode to code from your computer

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- You should have VSCode installed on your machine
- Running [`npx expo`](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) should not output any error
- Star the repository [react-native-bootcamp](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp) on the corner top right. This allows you to easily keep track of updates and new releases, as you will receive notifications when changes are made to the repository.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

### Create a new React Native project using expo

- [ ] Copy-paste the following commands in your terminal

```console
yarn create expo-app spacecraft --template expo-template-blank-typescript
```

```console
cd spacecraft
```

- [ ] To preview the app run this and scan the QR Code

```console
yarn
yarn start
```

Next, take a look at the project files in your text editor.

- The `package.json` file lists all available scripts and dependencies. Installing any new library updates this file.
- In every Expo project we also have an `app.json` file, which contains all the metadata for our app. This includes the app's name, bundle identifiers, and more.
- Lastly, we have our `App.tsx` file, which is an entry point for our application.

- [ ] Try changing text inside the `<Text>` component to see the changes immediately apply to the content in our app.

One thing you can do next is create a `src` folder where all our components and screens will be.

### Use a Material Design Library called [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/)

During this bootcamp, we are going to use the UI library called `react-native-paper` to have a nice look and feel.

- [ ] From your terminal, install the library with:

```console
yarn add react-native-paper
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context # From v5 there is a need to install react-native-safe-area-context for handling safe area.
```

_If you have issues double check the [setup instruction on the documentation](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/getting-started)._

- [ ] Paste your LoginScreen from the exercice 1 Snack into `App.tsx`

Congratulations 👏! You should have something like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/foundation/login.png" alt="Login Screen Preview" width="50%" height="50%" />

### Create another Screen

_Feel free to kill/relaunch your expo server if you encounter errors._

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `LoginScreen.tsx` and create 2 folders `src` and `screens` like this

```console
.
├── App.tsx
├── package.json
├── src
│    └── screens
│          └── LoginScreen.tsx
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx`
- [ ] Wrap your application with `PaperProvider` like this

```javascript
// App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';

import LoginScreen from './src/screens/LoginScreen';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <PaperProvider>
      <LoginScreen />
    </PaperProvider>
  );
};

// eslint-disable-next-line import/no-default-export
export default App;
```

Congratulations 👏! You created yout first screen component.

Remember, in **React Native everything is a component**.

It is always a good idea to create small components to your project. In our case, we are going to add a `<Header>` component.

- [ ] Create a folder `components` like this example:

```console
├── src
│    └── components
│          └── Header.tsx
```

- [ ] Create a new `<Header title="SpaceCraft"/>` component

**🔭 Hint:** Have a look a the section Patterns if you don't know how to create a React component.

- [ ] Compare with my [Header component solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/components/Header.tsx)

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Create a better ux for the password with an eye icon
