![Debug React Native like a Jedi master](https://media.giphy.com/media/SZugp2K9LkL6w/giphy.gif)

I think you may have a question at this point.

> Master Yoda, How can I use `debugger`, `console.log()`, and React Developer Tools?

## üì° What you will learn

- Using an app based on **the official React Native debugger**
- Simulate network condition

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

We are going to use **React Native Debugger** ‚Äîa standalone app that provides a comprehensive debugging experience for React Native applications.

It includes a debugger to step through code, inspect variables, and view the call stack. Additionally, it has a console for logging messages and interacting with code, as well as an element inspector for inspecting the UI.

You can use React Native Debugger with the React Developer Tools browser extension ‚Äî_included by default_‚Äî for a complete debugging experience.

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 01

- [ ] Install [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger#installation)

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

```console
brew update && brew install --cask react-native-debugger
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

You can have a look at [the releases on GitHub](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

[Download the zip from the release](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases).

‚ö†Ô∏è if **React Native Debugger**'s setup executable did not add the program to your Start Menu

For your convenience, you can fix this by pressing `WIN + R`, then type `%localappdata%\react_native_debugger`, and press `ENTER`.

This will take you to the installation folder for RND. Right-click on the `react-native-debugger.exe` file, and click **Create Shortcut** (on Windows 11, click **Show more options** to reveal the old context menu).

Copy the shortcut to `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` (you can make a folder inside Programs for organization purposes, and rename the shortcut for convenience when searching through your start menu). You will now be able to search for and launch the app from your Start Menu.

### How to use React Native Debugger with Expo

- [ ] Launch your project from your terminal

```console
yarn start
```

- Open **React Native Debugger**
- Add the Metro port (Generaly it's `19000`) with `command + t` (Or new tab like in a web browser)
- From your device you have multiple options to **open the Developer menu**:
  - Shake it if you are using a real device
  - From iOS simulator `control + command + z`
  - From Android simulator `command + m`
  - From a terminal `m`
- Start Remote Debugging

Congratulations üëè!

You know how to debug `JavaScript` with React Native.

### Testing your app with bad network

- [ ] Simulate a network connection
  - Go to the **Network tab** of your React Native debugger.
  - You can simulate a network connection by **clicking on the ‚ÄúNo throttling‚Äù dropdown**.
  - You can choose among presets such as **2G or 3G**.
