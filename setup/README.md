# Setup instructions

You will find the instructions to set up you computer for your next React Native Bootcamp.

ðŸ’¡ I do provide advices for Linux and macOS.

ðŸ’¡ Being **administrator on windows is mandatory**, I am **not responsible** if you encounter issues.
(_You can follow this [setup tutorial from InfiniteRed](https://academy.infinite.red/p/installing-react-native-tutorial-on-windows-10/) to make everything work_).

## System Requirements

- [ ] [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.13 or greater
- [ ] [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or greater
- [ ] [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Use the following command from your terminal to check your Node version.

```console
node --version
```

If you have a recent version installed, it should do.

For creating our React Native project we are going to use [Expo](https://expo.io/), which is an open-source platform for making native apps for Android and iOS using JavaScript.

```console
npm install --global expo-cli
```

## Virtual Simulators
